# Solution 1

## Requirements

- Matlab 2023b
- The Images and The Text Files

Delete the deleteme file inside of output and input_images
Simply just drop all of the files that start with 9 into the input_images folder

I have it setup so that if you only want to run CV algo through one image of you channel just keep the variable `runAll` to `false`

- You can then set the variable `id` to whatever image you want. It needs to be one of the name of the folders inside of `input_images`

If you want to run the algorithm with all the images just set `runAll` to `true`
